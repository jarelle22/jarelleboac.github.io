			<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Jarelle Boac and I'm an undergraduate student at Rutgers University- New Brunswick. I have always enjoyed inventing and being creative. Coding gives me the outlet to do just that. When I'm not coding, I'm cooking, traveling, or volunteering. Please check out the "Projects" and "Blog" sections to follow my journey as an aspiring developer and personal life. </p>
